A Markov chain is a mathematical model that describes a sequence of events where each event depends only on the previous state. This means that, no matter how you arrived at the current state, the future depends only on the present and not on the past.


If today is sunny (s):

There is a 60% chance it will stay sunny tomorrow.
There is a 30% chance it will become cloudy.
There is a 10% chance it will become rainy.
If today is rainy (r):

There is a 50% chance it will stay rainy tomorrow.
There is a 40% chance it will become sunny.
There is a 10% chance it will become cloudy.
If today is cloudy (c):

There is a 30% chance it will stay cloudy tomorrow.
There is a 50% chance it will become rainy.
There is a 20% chance it will become sunny.

This model is an example of a Markov chain where tomorrow’s weather depends only on today’s weather, not on previous days. It can be used to predict long-term weather trends by analyzing the probabilities of transitioning between different states.
